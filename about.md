# About this Repository

This site serves as a structured archive for findings, data points, and ongoing investigations. 

The goal is not to maintain a traditional blog, but to build a "second brain" where complex topics are broken down, verified, and updated as new information becomes available.

### Why this exists:
* **Evidence-Based:** To move beyond memory and maintain a record of why certain conclusions were reached.
* **Living Documents:** Unlike static articles, these notes are updated as investigations evolve.
* **Transparency:** Documenting the process of learning and the logic behind the findings.

*Questions or corrections? Feel free to reach out via GitHub.*
